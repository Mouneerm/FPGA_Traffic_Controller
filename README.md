# FPGA_Traffic_Controller


### Introduction
In this project, a Smart Traffic Light Controller was implemented in a dense traffic area in Mauritius using Finite State Machines. The location was chosen to be the intersection of Dr Maurice Cure St, Road A1, and Julius Nyerere Ave at Rose-Hill was chosen.

A finite state machine for pedestrian sensors was created and specifications for both the sensorsâ€™ functionality and the main controller were presented.

Ina addition, a finite state machine for the main controller was constructed. State assignment tables for the controller were created and codes were written using Aldec-Active HDL for FPGA implementation.

Simulations were performed to verify whether the proposed design was working as intended. This project demonstrates the practical application of Finite State Machines in traffic management systems.

### Objective
This project aims to improve the traffic congestion at the intersection of Dr Maurice Cure St, Nalla Ln Street, A1, and Julius Nyerere Ave at Rose- Hill. 
Also, this project would facilitate navigation of emergency vehicles from the Rose-Hill Police Station and Rose-Hill Area Health Centre on the (side roads) Julius and Dr Maurice Cure. 
During peak hours, priority would be shifted towards giving the main road A1 green lights. The number of pedestrians waiting to cross the road is also counted.
